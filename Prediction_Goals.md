# Goals

The objective of this hackathon is to develop a machine learning model to predict what a tourist will spend when visiting Tanzania.The model can be used by different tour operators and the Tanzania Tourism Board to automatically help tourists across the world estimate their expenditure before visiting Tanzania.

# Key Points

* Machine Learning Model
    * Predict Total Cost of Tourists

* Evaluation Metric MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
    * It is a measure used in statistics to quantify how close predictions or estimates are to the actual values.
* Alternative Metrics for Regression:
    * R^2
    * Adjusted R^2
    * MSE (Value) & RMSE (Original Value)
    * MAPE (Percentage of MAE)
